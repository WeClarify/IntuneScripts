# This script ensures that two registry values ("FarKdcTimeout" and "SpnCacheTimeout") 
# are correctly configured under the following registry path:
# "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters".
#
# Purpose:
# When using Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) with Kerberos Cloud Trust, 
# drive mappings may attempt to connect immediately after login. 
# If Global Secure Access (GSA) is not yet active, the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) request fails. 
# By reducing the timeout values for "FarKdcTimeout" and "SpnCacheTimeout" to 1 minute, 
# Kerberos can retry TGT requests more quickly, improving the reliability of drive mappings.
#
# Functionality:
# 1. Checks if the registry path exists:
#    - If it does not exist, the path is created.
# 2. Ensures that the "FarKdcTimeout" and "SpnCacheTimeout" values exist:
#    - If a value is missing or incorrect, it is created or updated with the correct setting.
# 3. Logs all actions performed and handles any errors.
#
# Configuration for Microsoft Intune:
# When deploying this script in Intune, ensure the following settings are configured:
# - Run this script using the logged on credentials: No
# - Enforce script signature check: No
# - Run script in 64 bit PowerShell Host: Yes
